MARLON:
- Get voice selection to look perfect
	✓ Try switching the way the voice selection and the playhead look...hmm. not sure. 
	✓ Try making all of the notes on non-current layers wireframe.	
	It looks less good...but it's *way* more usable.
	- Try adding an outline around the active material.
	- Try adding a grid to use when in top-down mode.
- Introduce the concept of play/stop
- Introduce vertical rotation
